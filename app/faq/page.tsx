  {
    question: "Can I come with a pre-formed team? Do I need to?",
    answer:
      "Either way works. You can show up with a team already, or you can form one at the event. At the start, everyone pitches ideas for apps or games they want to build, and you can join any idea that interests you. Your team doesn't have to be from your school or your grade.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to come with a pre-formed team?",
    answer:
      "Totally fine. We do suggest staying open to adding new teammates though. More people often means better ideas, and it's usually more fun.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I decide not to work with a team at all?",
    answer:
      "Also fine. Plenty of people work solo. That said, most people end up having more fun on a team.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Bits and Bytes?",
    answer:
      "A student-led tech club that runs hackathons and events. Our hackathons are loosely inspired by Hack Club's format but we do our own thing. We care about creativity, and a lot of attendees are new to coding. If that sounds fun, come through.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I volunteer for Bits and Bytes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We're almost always looking for organizers, day-of volunteers, workshop leads, and mentors. Reach out through our contact page.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of things can be made at our hackathons?",
    answer:
      "Anything you want. Well, almost anything. You can't make something that violates our Code of Conduct. It's a bit less strict than 'school appropriate,' but no offensive language targeting people's gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, or disabilities. No sexualized content, no harassment, nothing unsafe or illegal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do most people make?",
    answer:
      "Most people make games. A good chunk make mobile apps. A smaller number build websites or hardware projects. You can even make non-coding things: people have presented paintings and recorded albums. If you don't know what to make, you can always join an existing team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I show existing projects at Bits and Bytes?",
    answer: "No. All projects have to be built during the event.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can parents attend Bits and Bytes?",
    answer:
      "Not on the main floor, for security reasons. They can come to the kickoff and the awards ceremony. Parents can also attend if they volunteer and pass a background check, or if they're chaperoning a school group.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should we bring anything to the hackathon?",
    answer:
      "Bring a laptop. That's the main thing. You can bring whatever else you want on your device.",
  },
  {
    question: "For students staying overnight, what should they bring?",
    answer:
      "Toothbrush, toothpaste, a sleeping bag, a pillow, and a camping pad if you have one.",
  },
  {
    question: "For students with desktop computers, what should they bring?",
    answer:
      "We'd rather you bring a laptop. If you bring a desktop, you need to bring everything: keyboard, mouse, monitor, headphones (no speakers), a wifi adapter (venues don't let you plug into ethernet), and all your cables.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can students leave the hackathon and then come back?",
    answer:
      "Yes, but minors need a parent to pick them up or a signed note to leave on their own. You might not be able to come back at any hour. Venues lock down overnight, and security may not let you back in until morning.",
  },
